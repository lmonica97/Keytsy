## Overview

This app is my replication of the original website, Etsy.com. Similarly to the original website, it is a shopping site where users can browse items from a variety of categories to choose from. Unlike other shopping platforms, Keytsy only provides products from independent sellers-- people who want to sell their own hand-crafted items online.

## Keytsy was built with:
+ Ruby on Rails -- Backend
+ PostgresQL -- database structure 
+ ReactJS, NodeJS, Redux -- Frontend
+ AWS -- For product images

## Features
+ User Autherization -- Allows a User to create an account, sign in to an existing account, and sign out.
