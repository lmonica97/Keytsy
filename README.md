##Overview
+ This app is my replication of the original website, Etsy.com. Similarly to the original website, it is a shopping site where users can browse items from a variety of categories to choose from. Unlike other shopping platforms, Keytsy only provides products from independent sellers-- people who want to sell their own hand-crafted items online.
